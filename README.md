# Analyzing-Health-Parameters

Raunak Srivastava and I worked on a Heart Disease Analysis dataset and build a Case study on it. We found important factors related to heart disease and analyzed them using Python. We analyzed 13 different parameters related to health of individuals to predict the chances of them getting any disease. 

The data was clean so data cleaning wasn't required. We processed the variables and seperated them so that each variable gives information on one particular thing. We created dummy variable while building the models to make all the variables categorical. 

We build the Random Forest Classifier model with an accuracy of 92.4% to predict the heart disease. We analyzed the importance of each variable on the outcome to determine the most important features. ROC Curve and AUC Score were used to evaluate the model and calculate the model performance. We plotted multiple plots and graphs explaining the variables and the results.

**Conclusion:** We were able to successfully predict the heart diseases and we recognized the factors which directly affect health.
